Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe Game with Socket
Run directly the "Launcher.java" twice
  - the first to run will be the server and the second will be the client
  - use the appropriate ip adress otherwise it wouldn't work ( just use "localhost" and play in one computer if it won't work)
  - also use the same port
